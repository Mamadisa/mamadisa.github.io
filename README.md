### **PROJECTS:**

## Portfolio Optimization

- **Description:**  A portfolio optimization model that makes use of historical closing prices of selceted stocks from Yahoo finance API. It involves scaling the closing prices to set                        the data to start at uniform price, generate random weights for the stocks and calculate key metrics such as expected return, volatility, sharpe ratio and ROI. These                      key metrics were used to find the optimal portfolio using the Markowits Efficient Frontier- maximize returns whilst managing risk.
- **Skills Used:**  Time Series Analysis- data scaling, Data Analysis- performing simulation tests and calculating key metrics, Programming- wrote a Python code to collect, clean,                            perform calculations and generate visuals.
- **Highlights:**   The project demonstrated the need for diversification through the simulation runs with different stocks, it showed how correlation within and across industries impact                     portfolio perfomance. And futher highlighted not to 'put all your eggs in one basket' by showing how spreading investments across different stocks and industries                          helps manage risk.

## Regression Analysis

- **Description:** A linear regression model that predicts key business metrics such as revenue and costs. Involves preprocessing the data-differentiating which variables are categorical                    and numeric, selecting relevant features for the analysis and making predictions based on the processed data. Model provided insight on how different factors influence                    business performance and enhanced the ability to make informed decisions based on analytical insights
- **Skills Used:** Data Processing-Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, Regression Analysis-Selecting different dependent/independent variables for analysis and                       applying regression methods to predict outcome, Data Analysis- performing calculations such as MSE(mean-squared error) to assess model, Data Visualization-plot the                        relationships(correlation) of the variables and predicted models
- **Highlights:** The model showed a linear relationship between revenue and variables such as price, shipping cost and manufacturing cost which showed the direct impact price and                          expenses have on revenue. There was no significant linear relationship with shipping carriers, this indicated that it didn't matter who sold the products. 
## Financial Modeling

- **Description:** A financial model that uses a companpies financial statements such as Income Statement, Cash Flow Statements and given assumptions to forecast the companies future                        performance.
- **Skills Used:** Financial Modeling- Created an excel spreadsheet that allowed for different scenarios(base,worst and best case), Forecasting -applied methods based on assumptions to                      project future financial performances based on different business drivers.
- **Highlights:**  The model provided insight that could assist in decision making for sustainable business growth.
