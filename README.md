### **PROJECTS:**

## Portfolio Optimization

- **Description:**  A portfolio optimization model that makes use of historical closing prices of selceted stocks from Yahoo finance API. It involves scaling the closing prices to set                        the data to start at uniform price, generate random weights for the stocks and calculate key metrics such as expected return, volatility, sharpe ratio and ROI. These                      key metrics were used to find the optimal portfolio using the Markowits Efficient Frontier- maximize returns whilst managing risk.
- **Skills Used:**  Time Series Analysis- Data scaling, Data Analysis- performing simulation tests and calculating key metrics,Programming- wrote a Python code to collect, clean, perform                     calculations and generate visuals.
- **Highlights:**   The project demonstrated the need for diversification through the simulation runs with different stocks, it showed how correlation within and across industries impact                     portfolio perfomance. And futher highlighted not to 'put all your eggs in one basket' by showing how spreading investments across different stocks and industries                          helps manage risk.
